# FoodQue

FoodQue is created to save hawker culture in Singapore by helping hawkers that are unable to work with traditional food delivery platforms/ services without drastically increasing their food prices due to the high merchant commission fees (ranges from 30 per cent to 35 per cent - was cited by 52 hawkers as a reason why they continue to rely on walk-in customers).

So instead of increasing the prices of foods on the platforms, customers are able to order anything on our app by finding their task takers that are willing to deliver to them for a fee that the customers are willing to pay.

Also hawkers has huge decline in numbers of dine-in customers during this pandemic, traditional food delivery apps usually do not extend islandwide as there are delivery radius for most. 

Lastly as the older hawkers may not be that adept in technology, our app will focus our interactions between the users and the tasktakers (our delivery peeps).
